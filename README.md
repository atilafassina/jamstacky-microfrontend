# multiapp domain üöá

Proof-of-Concept of how **micro-frontend** would work within a Jamstack Architecture. It provides all performance benefits of a Jamstack applicaiton, together with the granularity of a micro-frontend for larger teams and apps.

## Limitations and pre-requistites üßê

- All pages should be unique across zones. For example, the main app should not have a `pages/login.tsx` page.
- The main app includes the `rewrites` within its `next.config.json` which maps to all other apps
- The secondary zones set `basePath` to their own main route (login sets to `/login`) so that generated pages and assets are within the respective subfolder.

## Ship them yourself üêë

To successfully deploy this project, you will need to click this button twice.

1. Set one of the apps as the root (`app/login` or `app/main`)
2. Set all the [environment variables](#environment-variables) for your deploy on that app
3. Repeat step for the other app

## Running it locally üõñ

1. Clone this repository
2. Add an `.env.local` to each of the apps according to docs below
3. At the root of the repo, run `yarn install`
4. Run `yarn dev`

Both apps will be served, now you can navigate to the main app's server.
Default is [localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)

## Environment Variables üîå

You can add `.env` files as described in the [Next.js docs](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables)
